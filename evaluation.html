      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Bedrunka’s homepage includes featured products, a searchbar to find a product and a few recipes for the user to try out. The page is designed with responsiveness in mind, so that the page is accessible on any resolution. Interactive buttons have descriptive text and a matching colour, so it is clear what it does.<br><br>
        Users can add, edit, or delete products and if the user wants to find a specific product, one can search for a product by id.<br><br>
        All sections are separated by a descriptive header and are easy to find by using the navigation bar on top which contains links to each section.<br><br>
        The page does not contain audio and can be printed for essential information, which is shown on the page.<br><br>
        Whole page was craeted by two students in just under a month of time. Limitations were that we had to learn and build the page from the scratch using the basics of our knowledge. The impact of it is that maybe the page does not look the best or could be improved in some aspects, but the page works correctly and is quite well done for such a short time period.

    <section id="highlights">
    <h2>Accessibility Highlights</h2>
      <p>
        We want our page to be accessible to as many users as possible and therefore we can use the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 to make sure this requirement is met.<br><br>
        The most important guideline is that all pieces of content should be easy to find on the page (2.4). If the user is unable to find something because of poor navigation or unclear design the user will likely not stay around and go to an alternative website.<br><br>
        Secondly, mobile browsers have surpassed desktop browsers in popularity, thus the web page should be viewable on more than one device, resolution, or aspect ratio (1.3). The webpage should be responsive to different layouts, so a user who uses a desktop, mobile phone, or someone who wants to print the page, can all view the website’s most important details.
      </p>

    <section id="plan">
      <h2>Improvement Plan</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Remove decorative content when using assistive technology</dt>
        <dd>
          Remove header image and ASCII art from other media types using CSS media queries.
        </dd>
        <dt>Increase contrast</dt>
        <dd>Increase contrast for "Reset Data" and "Add Product" buttons to comply with Level AAA. For this we will use colour picker.</dd>
        <dt>Line-spacing</dt>
        <dd>
          Line spacing (leading) should be at least space-and-a-half within paragraphs, and paragraph spacing is at least 1.5 times larger than the line spacing. This can be achieved by adding <code>line-height: 150%</code> in CSS for every text element.
        </dd>

        <dt>Selectable foreground and background colours</dt>
        <dd>
          Users should be able to select foreground and background colours. This can be achieved by only 
          specifying a CSS colour for secondary content such as banners, features, and navigation.
        </dd>

        <dt>Not everything is accessible by keyboard</dt>
        <dd>
          All functionality of the content should be operable through a keyboard interface without 
          requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function 
          requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints. 
          Issue seems to be laying on the side of buttons that were not actual HTML buttons, that is 
          why we will change the tags of these for <code>button</code>.
        </dd>

        <dt>Addition of list-style-type</dt>
        <dd>
          Due to this small overlook on our side, we can easily add this in CSS to existing table. 
          An examplary solution would be a type of numeration added to one of the present lists on the page.
        </dd>
        <dt>Correcting print style</dt>
        <dd>
          Print style has three main issues: too much empty space, scroll bars are visible and form is not deleted.
          Empty space could be fixed looking at the rules of <code>page-break</code> in CSS file. 
          We would also need to hide the scroll bars and form in <code>@media print</code> using <code>display: none</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Responsive table (problem resolved, not for implementation)</dt>
        <dd>
          This problem touches the screen users. The table does not flip but rather changes into being scrollable sideways, which was told to us by our TA. He said 
          that the table should rather collapse, but we still believe it is one of the correct versions 
          of how one can create a responsive table and by W3 standards, it is also a valid solution. 
          That is why it is the only part of Improvement plan that we decided not to improve, also because 
          of the fact that it would be problematic to implement and not get rid of a functionality or 
          causing the whole code to be overhauled in order to make everything work.

            <td>
              Guideline 1.1 states that all non-text content that is presented to the user should have an alternative. Bedrunka makes use of alternative text for every image on the page and descriptive names for buttons and input fields.<br><br>
              According to this guideline, all non-text content which is used only for decorative purposes should be implemented in a way it can be ignored by assistive technology. However, the header image and decorative ASCII art are still visible on assistive technology.<br><br>
              Bedrunka does not provide time-based media, tests, sensory input, or CAPTCHA.

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1.3</td>
            <td>
              All content on Bedrunka’s page is responsive in such a way that it can be read on any layout. Information is presented in text form and may provide an image with alternative text for clarification. Bedrunka does not use sensory characteristics for any information on the page.

            <td>1.4</td>
            <td>
              Bedrunka makes it easy for the users to distinguish content from the background by providing enough contrast in colour (AA). Only the “Delete Product” and “Reset Data” buttons do not provide enhanced contrast according to Level AAA.<br><br>
              Text is not justified and visible on 200 percent zoom without assistive technology, but the tables are only fully visible with horizontal scroll. The product returned from the search bar, however, does not provide a scrollbar and therefore the product is not entirely visible on 200 percent zoom. (AA)<br><br>
              No images of text are used to convey information except for any logos and there is no background audio. (AA)<br><br>
              No technique is used in CSS to ensure line spacing is at least space-and-a-half within paragraphs, and at least 1.5 times larger than the line spacing. (AAA)<br><br>
              Foreground and background colours cannot be selected by the user and Bedrunka does provide responsive text such that no horizontal scrolling will occur. (AAA)

            <td>
              All Bedrunka’s functionality should be accessible by keyboard but fails to comply as a user is unable to delete a product, reset data, or edit a product using the keyboard only. Sorting a table, searching a product or adding one is keyboard accessible without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes. (AAA)<br><br>
              It is always possible for the user to unfocus when focussing an element using the keyboard, thus there is no keyboard trap.

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2.4</td>
            <td>
              All Bedrunka’s web pages, including the Bedrunka API, provide a descriptive title, including Bedrunka’s brand name.<br><br>
              Navigation links are provided at the top of the page to skip blocks of content. The content itself is displayed in order and therefore the page can be navigated in a sequential focus order.<br><br>
              Links provide descriptive text, so it is easy for the user to understand what it links to (AAA). Besides this, the user can also visit almost any part of the website using the correct URL (AAA) by manually scrolling to it (AA). Searching for a product and editing one are the only processes on our website. The user is not able to locate the result of every product unless a search is performed, and you can only update a product or cancel this process after the user has pressed the Edit Product button.<br><br>
              All headings and input labels are descriptive and are used to organize content (AA & AAA). Keyboard focus indicators are visible where necessary and links are visible at any time and the user can always deduct the purpose of the link before using it. (AA)
