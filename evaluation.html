    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h2>Accessibility Highlights</h2>
    <h2>Improvement Plan</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Addition of list-style-type</dt>
      <dd>
        Due to this small overlook on our side, we can easily add this in CSS to existing table. 
        An examplary solution would be a type of numeration added to one of the present lsits on the page.
      </dd>
      <dt>Correcting print style</dt>
      <dd>
        Print style has three main issues: too much empty space, scroll bars are visible and form is not deleted.
        Empty space could be fixed looking at the rules of <code>page-break</code> in CSS file. 
        We would also need to hide the scroll bars and form in <code>@media print</code> using <code>display: none</code>
      </dd>
      <dt>Responsive table (problem resolved, not for implementation)</dt>
      <dd>
        This problem touches the screen users. The table does not flip and does not become vertical 
        but rather changes into being scrollable sideways, which was told to us by our TA. He said 
        that the table should rather collapse, but we still believe it is one of the correct versions 
        of how one can create a responsive table and by W3 standards, it is also a valid solution. 
        That is why it is the only part of Improvement plan that we decided not to improve, also because 
        of the fact that it would be problematic to implement and not get rid of a functionality or 
        causing the whole code to be overhauled in order to make everything work.
